Hello everyone, we have understood by now that how social distancing can really help in breaking the chain.
Being a Computer Vision enthusiast, I have tried to built a model which can detect the number of faces and can show a message if the faces are very close to each other. 
This can be a small prototype of a model which can be implemented through the CCTV cameras for surveillance by the police. It can be integrated with mobile applications so that violation of social distancing can be easily reported.

- Using Basic opencv library functions
- Haar-cascade frontal face Classifier used to detect faces
- Detect the number of faces
- The distance between 2 faces
